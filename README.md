# block_chain_project

Overview
This project is a basic blockchain built in Python.
It shows how blocks are created, hashed with SHA‑256, mined using Proof of Work, and added to a chain.
The goal is to understand how blockchain works in a simple way.

Features
Create blocks with index, timestamp, data, previous hash, nonce, and hash

Mining with chossing the difficulty state , default is "0000" you can change if you want 

(more number in diffeculty the more affort it will take from pc to find the righ hash)

Chain validation

Prints full blockchain

How to Run
Install Python 3

Run the file:

python blockchain.py
The program will mine blocks and print the chain.
